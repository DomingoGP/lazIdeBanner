This project is a [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) ide plugin that inserts banners in the source editor.

Also there is a standalone tool that does the same.

It implements "partially" rendering of fonts from [figlet](http://www.figlet.org/) project in **Lazarus/Freepascal**.

After install in the lazarus ide you have to select the fonts folder and save the settings.

This add-on ads a submenu "Insert Banner..." in the "**Source**" submenu of the IDE.
